# Calendar Printing Program by Lawrence Ikhidero

This is a simple C program that prints a calendar for a given year.

## Getting Started

To use this program, you will need to compile the code using a C compiler, such as GCC or Clang. Once the code is compiled, you can run the resulting executable to print the calendar.

### Prerequisites

To compile the code, you will need to have a C compiler installed on your system. On Linux systems, GCC is a popular choice. On macOS, you can use Clang, which is included with Xcode.

### Compiling the Code

To compile the code, navigate to the directory containing the `calendar.c` file and run the following command:

### gcc -o calendar calendar.c

This will compile the code and create an executable file named `calendar`.

### Running the Program

To run the program, simply execute the `calendar` executable:

### ./calendar

This will print the calendar for the year specified in the `year` variable in the code. By default, the calendar will have a 2-character width for each day and a 1-character space between columns, starting on a Monday and with 6 characters of space between each column.

## Modifying the Program

To modify the program to print a calendar for a different year, simply change the value of the `year` variable in the code to the desired year. You can also adjust the other variables in the code to change the width of the columns, the starting day of the week, and the spacing between columns.
